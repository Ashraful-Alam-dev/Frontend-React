      <p>Hello! I'm Ashraful Alam, a passionate developer and tech enthusiast.</p>
      <p>
        I created this blog to share thoughts on travel, lifestyle, technology,
        and personal experiences. I'm always excited to learn, build, and connect
        with others through stories and ideas.

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling, photography, and exploring different cultures.
        Thanks for visiting my blog!
